--] this is for d2c, the future project, d2 is a successor for the double, as described below.
-] d2c:
everything is a function, there is nothing outside the functions
there is a global() function, even though you can't see it! which keeps everything
there is also the main() function

phase a:
    tokenize
phase b:
    lex
phase c:
    combine
phase d:
    parse buffer to functions
phase d1:
    parse functions to expressions
phase e:
    convert infix function arguments and expressions to prefix

-] d2
everything is variable, there is no data encapsulation, just variables, code blocks and threads
phase a:
    tokenize
phase b:
    lex
phase c:
    combine
phase d:
    resolve blocks recursively
phase e:
  convert infix to prefix everywhere!
